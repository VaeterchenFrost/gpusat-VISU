In this paper we present a framework for producing circular drawings of networks represented by non-biconnected graphs. Furthermore, the drawings produced by these techniques clearly show the biconnectivity structure of the given networks. We also include results of an extensive experimental study which shows our approach to significantly outperform the current state of the art.",

This gives an alternative proof of a recent result by Courcelle. We allow graphs with directed and/or undirected edges, labeled on edges and/or vertices with labels taken from a finite set. We extend MS properties to extended monadic second-order (EMS) problems involving counting or summing evaluations over sets definable in monadic second-order logic. Our technique allows us also to solve some EMS problems in linear time or in polynomial or pseudopolynomial time for classes of graphs of fixed bounded treewidth. Moreover, it is shown that each EMS problem is in NC for graphs of bounded treewidth. Most problems for which linear time algorithms for graphs of bounded treewidth were previously known to exist, and many others, are EMS problems."

We prove that evaluating a fixed monadic second order (MSO) query {\$}{\backslash}varphi({\backslash}bar{\{}X{\}}){\$}(i.e. computing all the tuples that satisfy the MSO formula) in a binary tree is a Linear-Delaylinproblem. More precisely, we show that given a binary tree T and a tree automaton $\Gamma$ representing an MSO query {\$}{\backslash}varphi({\backslash}bar{\{}X{\}}){\$}, we can evaluate $\Gamma$ on T with a preprocessing in time and space complexity O(|$\Gamma$|3|T|) and an enumeration phase with a delay O(|S|) and space O(max|S|) where |S| is the size of the next solution and max|S| is the size of the largest solution. We introduce a new kind of algorithm with nice complexity properties for some algebraic operations on enumeration problems. In addition, we extend the precomputation (with the same complexity) such that the ith(with respect to a certain order) solution S is produced directly in time O(|S|log(|T|)). Finally, we generalize these results to bounded treewidth structures.",
