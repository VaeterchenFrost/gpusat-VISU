	abstract = "{Visualization is an important technique for understanding and exploring complex models. To be useful, visualizations have to be specifically tailored towards the visualization task and the analyzed model. Many standard charts or graph-based visualizations exist, but need to be mapped to the concepts of the model under study. Existing model visualization tools often have predetermined visualization kinds and content, impeding reuse of standard visualizations for various purposes, or lacking the ability to flexibly map source model concepts to different visualization elements. This paper presents ELVIZ (Every Language Visualization"), an approach to vi-" sualization, generic regarding both the source model, and the kind and content of the visualization. ELVIZ applies model-driven engineering techniques both to transform arbitrary source models into the desired visualization models, and to generate said model transformations from a query-based mapping of source model concepts to visualization concepts. This cleanly decouples source and visualization meta-models, allowing to reuse and combine standard visualizations for various source models. The ELVIZ approach is applied to scenarios from software visualization in software evolution and measuring energy consumption of mobile applications, using different kinds of visualizations.}"

This gives an alternative proof of a recent result by Courcelle. We allow graphs with directed and/or undirected edges, labeled on edges and/or vertices with labels taken from a finite set. We extend MS properties to extended monadic second-order (EMS) problems involving counting or summing evaluations over sets definable in monadic second-order logic. Our technique allows us also to solve some EMS problems in linear time or in polynomial or pseudopolynomial time for classes of graphs of fixed bounded treewidth. Moreover, it is shown that each EMS problem is in NC for graphs of bounded treewidth. Most problems for which linear time algorithms for graphs of bounded treewidth were previously known to exist, and many others, are EMS problems."

We prove that evaluating a fixed monadic second order (MSO) query {\$}{\backslash}varphi({\backslash}bar{\{}X{\}}){\$}(i.e. computing all the tuples that satisfy the MSO formula) in a binary tree is a Linear-Delaylinproblem. More precisely, we show that given a binary tree T and a tree automaton $\Gamma$ representing an MSO query {\$}{\backslash}varphi({\backslash}bar{\{}X{\}}){\$}, we can evaluate $\Gamma$ on T with a preprocessing in time and space complexity O(|$\Gamma$|3|T|) and an enumeration phase with a delay O(|S|) and space O(max|S|) where |S| is the size of the next solution and max|S| is the size of the largest solution. We introduce a new kind of algorithm with nice complexity properties for some algebraic operations on enumeration problems. In addition, we extend the precomputation (with the same complexity) such that the ith(with respect to a certain order) solution S is produced directly in time O(|S|log(|T|)). Finally, we generalize these results to bounded treewidth structures.",
